# This library is poorly written

I don't have the time to rewrite it. If you'd like to take the package name, please contact me. Feel free to use the code as reference.

Python doesn't really work for big binary format parsing anyway. If I were to rewrite this, I'd use native code.

# osu.py
A multipurpose osu! library, aiming to cover practically any use case over time. Please open an issue if the feature you want isn't supported.

Currently it supports osu!.db, collection.db, scores.db, beatmaps, replays and has a limited api support

Install: `pip install osu.py`
